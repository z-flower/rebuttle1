__Q1:__ 1:The model presents limited novelty (the improvement likely comes from the use of more contemporary LLMs rather than the method itself), but the experimentation is interesting as a benchmark validating this dataset. Overall, I feel that the dataset is the main contribution of this work, which would be useful for future research.
2:I would suggest the authors to enlist the help of a proficient English speaker to improve readability of the paper. It's overall understandable, but would benefit from being polished.

Your insights into our work are greatly appreciated! 

Firstly, you mentioned the limited novelty of the model and suggested that the improvement might primarily stem from the use of more modern language models rather than the method itself. **Regarding the novelty of the large language model, indeed, our focus was predominantly on utilizing more contemporary pre-trained language model (LLM), and the advancements of the LLM significantly boosted task performance. However, our new method - BvSP, targeting the few-shot ASQP task, has shown promising potential in handling unseen aspects with only a few supported samples**. While part of the improvement can be attributed to advancements in LLMs, the method we introduced still demonstrated a certain efficacy for specific tasks, offering some insights for future research in this domain.

Secondly, **we are thrilled by your positive evaluation of the dataset! Creating the FSQP dataset was a pivotal aspect of our work, aiming to provide an effective platform to validate few-shot ASQP methods.** It provides a more balanced representation and covers a wider range of categories, offering as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating few-shot ASQP. We hope it can serve as a valuable resource for future research, driving advancements in this field. Your recognition of the dataset validates our efforts and motivates us. We will continue refining our work, exploring innovative pathways, and consistently enhancing and expanding the dataset to provide a more beneficial and impactful resource for the research community. 
Moreover, we truly appreciate your feedback on the readability of our paper. Ensuring clarity and readability is paramount. We will certainly take your advice into account and seek assistance from proficient English speakers to enhance the paper's readability and overall quality. 
Once again, thank you for your feedback; we greatly appreciate it and will earnestly consider the points and suggestions you've raised.
